# Elevator Robot Project

A project of the 2020 Robotics Course of the School of Information Science and Technology (SIST) of ShanghaiTech University

## Introduction

In this project, we tried to make a robot capable of taking elevators autonomously. With the ability to take elevators and move vertically inside a building, the mobility of wheeled robots can be significantly improved.

## System Description

### Hardware

Our elevator robot includes a complex hardware system consists of the following parts:

* **Base platform** - Jackal
* **Manipulator** - Kinova
* **Camera** - Intel Realsense
* **3D LiDAR** - Velodyne

### Software

The whole software system is a multi-phased pipeline based on ROS melodic on Ubuntu 18.04.

* **Localization and Navigation** - AMCL algorithm

* **Button Detection** - OCR-RCNN algorithm

* **Button Push** - MoveIt!

The lower left image indicates the target pose of the manipulator where it pushes the button with the pose represented by the red arrow in RViz in the right.
